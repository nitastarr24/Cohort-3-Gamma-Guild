Week 1 — Day 2 Assignment
Name: Nita
Topic: Blockchain infrastructure, distributed ledgers, and how NFTs & tokens change ownership

What I Learnt
Today’s topic opened my eyes to how much thought goes into what we call blockchain. It’s not just about crypto or NFTs but an entire infrastructure built on nodes, consensus, and community trust.
I learned how blockchains differ from distributed ledgers, how networks reach agreement without a central boss, and how NFTs and tokens are quietly redefining what it means to own something in the digital world.

### Blockchain Infrastructure: 4 Examples
1. Bitcoin
Purpose: The purpose is simply to send and store value without banks.


Nodes: Full nodes (validate transactions) and miners (create blocks).


Client: Bitcoin Core (the main software that runs the network).


Consensus: Proof of Work (miners solve puzzles to secure the network).


2. Ethereum
Purpose: It is the home of smart contracts and DeFi.


Nodes: Full, archive, and validator nodes.


Clients: Geth, Nethermind, Besu.


Consensus: Proof of Stake where validators “stake” ETH to propose and confirm blocks.


3. Solana
Purpose: Fast transactions for scalable apps.


Nodes: Validators and leaders handle transaction order.


Consensus: Proof of History + Proof of Stake — time-stamped data keeps things fast.


4. Polygon
Purpose: The purpose is to make Ethereum cheaper and faster.


Nodes: Validators on the Heimdall and Bor layers.


Consensus: Proof of Stake  (security with lower fees).


Distributed Ledger vs Blockchain
### Distributed Ledger (DLT) vs Blockchain

| **Feature** | **Distributed Ledger (DLT)** | **Blockchain** |
|--------------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| **Structure** | Shared database across many systems | Data stored in linked blocks |
| **Order of Data** | Doesn’t always need strict order | Blocks are chained chronologically |
| **Governance** | Can be private or permissioned | Usually public and open |
| **Examples** | Hyperledger Fabric | Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana |

In short, every blockchain is a distributed ledger, but not every distributed ledger is a blockchain.


### NFTs and Tokens
Before Web3, owning something online didn’t really mean you owned it. You just had access through someone’s platform. NFTs and tokens changed that.
Now, ownership is verified on-chain. Your wallet is your identity, and your NFT or token proves what’s yours whether it’s art, music, or digital money.

### NFTs and Tokens: Real-World Examples

| **Type** | **Example** | **What it Represents** | **Why it Matters** |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| **NFT** | Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) | Art + membership | Owners get IP rights, access, and community perks. |
| **NFT** | NBA Top Shot | Sports highlights | Collect digital “moments” verified on-chain. |
| **NFT** | Lens Protocol | Social profile | Own your content and social identity. |
| **NFT** | Sound.xyz | Music drops | Artists sell limited music NFTs with royalties. |
| **Token** | ETH | Currency + gas fee | Used to pay for transactions and staking. |
| **Token** | USDC | Stablecoin | Dollar-backed token for stable transactions. |


### How NFTs and Tokens Change Ownership
Fungible tokens (like ETH, MATIC, USDC) are interchangeable (one token equals another). They make money programmable.
NFTs are unique which means no two are the same. They make digital ownership real by attaching identity, art, or utility to one verifiable token.
Owning an NFT means your wallet holds proof that “this is mine,” not a screenshot.
It’s like owning a digital house deed instead of just renting space online.

Before this lesson, I thought blockchain was only about crypto but now I understand it’s a system of trust, transparency, and collaboration and NFTs are just one way people are using it to give digital ownership real meaning.
